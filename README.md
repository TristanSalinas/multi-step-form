# A simple multi-step Form.

This design was sourced from Front-End Mentor. I completed this mini-project to further practice working with **Tailwind**, **React**, and **TypeScript**.

The project follows a mobile-first approach.

I chose to use **React Router** to navigate and organize the app and **Context** to maintain information between steps.

[Here is the result](https://tristansalinas.github.io/multi-step-form/)
